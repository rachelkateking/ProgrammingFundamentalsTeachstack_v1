# Basic While Loop

This exercise introduces you to the fundamental concept of while loops in Python. A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

## Task

Create a while loop that prints the numbers 1 through 5, each on a new line.

## Example Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Tips
- Start with a variable (like `number`) set to 1
- Use a while condition to check if the number is less than or equal to 5
- Inside the loop, print the number
- Don't forget to increment your counter variable!
